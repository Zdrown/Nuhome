DEBUGGING EMAILJS ERROR: "The recipients address is empty"

If you are seeing the error "The recipients address is empty" in your console or logs when trying to submit the form, it means EmailJS doesn't know where to send the email.

Even though we are passing 'user_email' in the template parameters, this error specifically refers to the destination email address (where the notification should be sent), not the user's email address.

To fix this:

1. Go to your EmailJS Dashboard (https://dashboard.emailjs.com/).
2. Navigate to "Email Templates".
3. Select the template you are using (ID: template_9z7zs2i).
4. Click on the "Settings" tab (or look for the "To Email" field in the template editor).
5. Ensure the "To Email" field is configured.
   - If you want to receive the notifications yourself, enter your own email address here.
   - If you want it to be dynamic (e.g. send to the user), you would use the variable {{user_email}}, but typically for a contact form, you want to receive the email, so you should put your own email address (e.g., zachariah@nuhomemoving.com).

Once you save this setting in the EmailJS dashboard, the error should resolve.
